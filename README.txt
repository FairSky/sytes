Sytes -- a library for making quick websites with Common Lisp
=============================================================

Sytes implements a Lispy template language, as well as Hunchentoot
handlers for easily mapping HTTP requests to templates on disk.
Templates may “inherit” from other templates, or process other
templates.  The language available templates is a Scheme-like
mini-language providing very few primitive operations.
